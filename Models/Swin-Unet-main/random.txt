show the architecture diagram of network model with all thier components all the model 
related flags if possible show the baseline architecture of network model along with 
fusion methods implemented like fourier, smart skip connection and many more. show all components which are controlled through flag. 

if i want to run baseline with this features
EfficientNetB4 Encoder → bottleneck(with 2 swin blocks) - SwinTranformer Decoder
- Basic CNN encoder blocks
- Simple concatenation skip connections like hybrid2 model's baseline skip connection
- GroupNorms(--use_groupnorm as implemented in hybrid2 model ) instead of BatchNorms(groupnorms are controllable by flag in hybrid2) as default
- all three losses(ce, dice and focal)
--keep segmentation head same as that of baseline model of hybrid2
- No smart skip connection(keep the functionality but controllable by flag)
- No fourier feature fusion
- No multi-scale aggregation
- no deep supervision
- differential lr for cnn encoder, bottleneck with 2 swin block and transformer decoder.
- keep adapter_mode streaming as default for baseline network model.
then how do i run? are there flags for baseline, flags for fourier fusion, smart skip connection, multi-scale aggregation, deep supervision, Freezing if yes then keep the component controllable by command line arguments flags
